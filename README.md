# stocks_twitter_bot
This Python script uses tweepy and the Twitter API to update users on stock information. The script runs a bot which monitor's the host account's mentions list and, when the host is tagged along with a stock symbol in the body of the tweet, responds with whether the indicated stock is currently up or down on the day and by what percent.
(Note: my personal Twitter API credentials have been replaced by placholder names)
